# [GFRNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04829)
 Torch implementation for [Learning Warped Guidance for Blind Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04829)

# GFRNet framework
Overview of our GFRNet. The <B>WarpNet</B> takes the degraded observation and guided image as input to predict the dense flow field, which is adopted to deform guided image to the warped guidance. Warped guidance is expected to be spatially well aligned with ground-truth. Thus the <B>RecNet</B> takes warped guidance and degradated observation as input to produce the restoration result.

# Results
## Restoration on real low quality images
The first row is real low quality image(close-up in right bottom is the guided image). The second row is GFRNet result.
